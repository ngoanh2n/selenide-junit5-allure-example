# If the pattern consists solely of an asterisk (*), all conditions will be deactivated.
# Otherwise, the pattern will be used to match against the fully qualified class name (FQCN) of each registered condition.
# Any dot (.) in the pattern will match against a dot (.) or a dollar sign ($) in the FQCN. Any asterisk (*) will match against one or more characters in the FQCN
# All other characters in the pattern will be matched one-to-one against the FQCN.
#
# Examples:
# - *: deactivates all conditions.
# - org.junit.*: deactivates every condition under the org.junit base package and any of its subpackages.
# - *.MyCondition: deactivates every condition whose simple class name is exactly MyCondition.
# - *System*: deactivates every condition whose simple class name contains System.
# - org.example.MyCondition: deactivates the condition whose FQCN is exactly org.example.MyCondition.

# Property name used to enable auto-detection and registration of extensions via Java's ServiceLoader mechanism.
# The default behavior is not to perform auto-detection.

# Property name used to set the default test instance lifecycle mode
# Supported values include names of enum constants defined in TestInstance.Lifecycle.
# If not specified, the default is "per_method" which corresponds to @TestInstance(Lifecycle.PER_METHOD).

# Property name used to enable parallel test execution
# By default, tests are executed sequentially in a single thread.
junit.jupiter.execution.parallel.enabled=false

# Property name used to set the default test execution mode
# This setting is only effective if parallel execution is enabled.
# Supported values include names of enum constants defined in ExecutionMode.
# + same_thread
# + concurrent
# If not specified, the default is "same_thread" which corresponds to @Execution(ExecutionMode.SAME_THREAD).

# Property name used to set the default test execution mode for top-level classes
# This setting is only effective if parallel execution is enabled.
# Supported values include names of enum constants defined in ExecutionMode.
# + same_thread
# + concurrent
# If not specified, it will be resolved into the same value as DEFAULT_PARALLEL_EXECUTION_MODE.
junit.jupiter.execution.parallel.mode.classes.default=concurrent

# Property name used to select the ParallelExecutionConfigurationStrategy
# Potential values: dynamic (default), fixed, or custom.
junit.jupiter.execution.parallel.config.strategy=fixed

# Property name used to set the desired parallelism for the fixed configuration strategy
# No default value; must be a positive integer.
junit.jupiter.execution.parallel.config.fixed.parallelism=6
